## Motivation
- When systems based on different models are combined, the need for the new system to adapt to the semantics of the other system can lead to a corruption of the new systemâ€™s own model.

## Solution
### Concepts
![](../../diagrams/png/anti_corruption_layer_small.png)
- Place an adapter layer between 2 domain models and translate communications between them.

### Implementation
- The anti-corruption layer can be implemented as a component within the application or as an independent service.
- The anti-corruption layer can be bidirectional.

## Pros & Cons
### Pros
- Improve the isolation between the 2 domain models.

### Cons
- May add latency to calls made between the 2 domain models.

## Consideration
| Topic | Consideration | Possible Solution Options |
|----|-----|-----|

## When To Use
Two or more domain models have different semantics, but still need to communicate.
