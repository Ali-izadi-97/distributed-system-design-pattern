## Motivation
- When systems based on different models are combined, the need for the new system to adapt to the semantics of the other system can lead to a corruption of the new systemâ€™s own model.

## Solution
### Concepts
![](../../diagrams/png/anti_corruption_layer_small.png)
- Place an adapter layer between 2 domain models and translate communications between them.

### Implementation
- General advices
   - The anti-corruption layer can be implemented as a component within the application or as an independent service.
   - The anti-corruption layer can be bidirectional.
   - Functionality can be added to the anti-corruption layer if it is specific to the relationship of the two subsystems, like audit log or trace logic.

## Pros & Cons
### Pros
- Improve the isolation and reduce the friction between the 2 domain models.

### Cons
- May add latency to calls made between the 2 domain models.

## Consideration

## When To Use
Two or more domain models have different semantics, but still need to communicate.
