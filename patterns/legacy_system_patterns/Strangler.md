## Motivation
- the big-bang (cut-over) rewrite of the legacy application is extremely risky and will likely end in failure.

## Solution
### Concepts
- Incrementally refactor the legacy application to the new application and services.

### Implementation
- General advices
   - Migrate the high-value areas of the legacy application to the new application first.
   - Avoid making widespread changes to the legacy applicaton when migrating to the new application.
   - Design the new application in such a way as to make it easier for it to be strangled (refactored) in the future.

## Pros & Cons
### Pros
- Reduce the risk of the big-bang (cut-over) rewrite of the legacy application.
- Demonstrate the value of refactoring the legacy application early and often.

### Cons

## Consideration
| Topic | Consideration | Possible Solution Options |
|----|-----|-----|
| Collaboration | How to collaborate between the legacy application and the new application during the migration. | <li>Implementing an anti-corruption layer (ACL) between the legacy application and the new application.<li>Create a fa√ßade that route requests either to the legacy application or the new application. |
