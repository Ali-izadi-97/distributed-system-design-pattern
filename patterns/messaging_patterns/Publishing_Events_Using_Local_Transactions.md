## Motivation
- How to update the database and publish a message (event) atomically (either all success, or all fail).
- Cannot use distributed transaction pattens to solve this problem.
   - Many modern message brokers donâ€™t support distributed transactions.

## Solution
### Concepts
![](../../diagrams/png/publishing_events_using_local_transactions_small.png)
- Uses the event table to store the events need to be published.
- Bundles the operation of inserting new record into a business entity table and the operation of inserting a new event to the event table as a single local database transaction.
- Event publisher publishes events by polling the event table periodically.

### Implementation

## Pros & Cons
### Pros
- The atomicity of updating the database and publishing a message (event) is guaranteed.

### Cons
- Frequently polling the database can be expensive.
- Tricky to publish events in order.
- Not all NoSQL databases support this pattern.

## Consideration
| Topic | Consideration | Possible Solution Options |
|----|-----|-----|
| Error handling | The event publisher may publish a event more than once (For example, crash after publishing an event but before marking the corresponding event record as published). | <li>Consider to let the event consumer be idempotent by recording the IDs of the events that it has already processed. |
