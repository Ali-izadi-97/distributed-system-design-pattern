# Distributed Actor Frameworks

| Product | Description |
|---|---|
| Akka | Uses Javaâ€™s built-in serialization by default, which does not provide forward or backward compatibility. However, you can replace it with something like Protocol Buffers, and thus gain the ability to do rolling upgrades. |
| Orleans | Supports rolling upgrades using its own versioning mechanism. It allows new actor methods to be defined (that is, new types of incoming message that an actor can process) while maintaining backward compatibility, provided that existing methods are not changed. |
| Erlang OTP | It is surprisingly hard to make changes to record schemas (despite the system having many features designed for high availability); rolling upgrades are possible but need to be planned carefully. An experimental new maps datatype (a JSON-like structure, introduced in Erlang R17 in 2014) may make this easier in the future. |
